This is a resubmission of an initial release. The first submission review
comments requested:

* References to sources also be added to the package DESCRIPTION, and
* A re-wording of a sentence in the package DESCRIPTION.

Both comments have been addressed. Adding the requested reference introduced
the NOTE:

```
Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Strack (7:28)
  al (7:38)
  et (7:35)
```

The noted words are spelled as intended.

Otherwise, the package checks are free of ERRORs, WARNINGs, and NOTEs.
